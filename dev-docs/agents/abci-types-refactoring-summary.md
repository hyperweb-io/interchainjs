# ABCI Types Refactoring Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the refactoring of ABCI-related types in the interchainjs cosmos network package, following the lessons learned from the adapter refactoring.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created New Type Organization Structure
- Created `/networks/cosmos/src/types/responses/abci.ts` to house ABCI-related response types
- Created `/networks/cosmos/src/types/responses/index.ts` for re-exports

### 2. Moved Types to Dedicated File
The following types were moved from `responses.ts` to `responses/abci.ts`:
- `ProofOp` - Represents a single proof operation
- `QueryProof` - Represents a proof for a query
- `AbciQueryResponse` - Response from an ABCI query
- `AbciInfoResponse` - Response from an ABCI info query

### 3. Implemented Creator Functions
Added type-safe creator functions for each type:
- `createProofOp()` - Creates a ProofOp instance
- `createQueryProof()` - Creates a QueryProof instance
- `createAbciQueryResponse()` - Creates an AbciQueryResponse instance
- `createAbciInfoResponse()` - Creates an AbciInfoResponse instance

### 4. Updated Adapters
Updated all three adapters to use the new pattern:
- `tendermint34.ts`
- `tendermint37.ts`
- `comet38.ts`

Key improvements in adapters:
- Changed method signatures to use generics: `decodeAbciInfo<T extends AbciInfoResponse = AbciInfoResponse>(response: unknown): T`
- Replaced direct object creation with creator functions
- Improved type safety by using `unknown` instead of `any` for input parameters
- Added proper type casting with explicit assertions

### 5. Updated Base Adapter
- Added imports for the new types
- Updated the `ResponseDecoder` interface to use proper types
- Updated abstract method signatures in `BaseAdapter` class

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Better Organization**: ABCI-related types are now in their own file, making them easier to find and maintain
2. **Type Safety**: Creator functions ensure type-safe object construction
3. **Consistency**: All adapters now follow the same pattern for decoding responses
4. **Maintainability**: Nested type decoding is now handled through creator functions
5. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new ABCI-related types in the future

## Next Steps

Based on the refactoring lessons, the next types to refactor could be:
- Block-related types (Block, BlockHeader, BlockMeta, etc.)
- Transaction-related types (TxResponse, TxData, TxProof, etc.)
- Consensus-related types (ConsensusParams, ConsensusState, etc.)
- Validator-related types (Validator, ValidatorSet, etc.)

Each group should follow the same pattern:
1. Create a dedicated file in `types/responses/`
2. Move related types to the new file
3. Implement creator functions for each type
4. Update imports and exports
5. Update adapters to use the creator functions
