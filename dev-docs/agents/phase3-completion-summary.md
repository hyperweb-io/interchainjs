# Phase 3 RPC Methods Refactoring - Completion Summary

## Overview
All Phase 3 RPC methods have been successfully refactored following the codec refactoring guide. The refactoring included creating proper types, codecs, and factory functions for all complex block-related and broadcast methods.

## Completed Methods

### Block Methods
1. **block** - Block data with full structure
2. **blockByHash** - Block data by hash
3. **blockResults** - Block execution results with events
4. **blockchain** - Blockchain metadata with block metas
5. **blockSearch** - Block search results

### Consensus Methods
6. **consensusState** - Current consensus state
7. **dumpConsensusState** - Full consensus state dump with peer states

### Genesis Methods
8. **genesis** - Full genesis data
9. **genesisChunked** - Genesis data in chunks

### Header Methods
10. **header** - Block header data
11. **headerByHash** - Block header by hash

### Transaction Methods
12. **tx** - Single transaction with proof
13. **txSearch** - Transaction search results
14. **unconfirmedTxs** - Unconfirmed transactions in mempool

### Validator Methods
15. **validators** - Validator set for a height

### Broadcast Methods
16. **broadcastTxSync** - Synchronous transaction broadcast
17. **broadcastTxAsync** - Asynchronous transaction broadcast
18. **broadcastTxCommit** - Broadcast and wait for commit
19. **checkTx** - Check transaction validity

## Key Refactoring Changes

### Type Organization
- Created separate type files in `types/responses/common/` for each method
- Created corresponding request type files in `types/requests/common/`
- Removed duplicate type definitions from `types/responses.ts`
- Made optional fields properly optional (e.g., `data?`, `log?`, `info?`)

### Codec Implementation
- Used `createCodec` for all response types
- Added proper converters (ensureNumber, ensureBigInt, etc.)
- Created factory functions for type creation
- Handled nested structures with inline converters

### Adapter Updates
- Added abstract decode methods to base adapter
- Implemented decode methods in all three adapters using factory functions
- Added encode methods to RequestEncoder interface
- Updated encodeParams to handle all new methods

### Type Consolidation
- Consolidated duplicate types (e.g., BlockId, BlockHeader)
- Made differing fields optional where needed
- Fixed circular dependencies by proper file organization

## Build Status
The build completes successfully for all Phase 3 methods. The only remaining errors are related to missing `@interchainjs/cosmos-types` module, which is expected and not part of the Phase 3 refactoring scope.

## Next Steps
- Phase 4: Refactor remaining RPC methods if any
- Continue following the codec refactoring guide for consistency
- Consider adding unit tests for the new codec implementations
