# Consensus State Method Refactoring Checklist

## Method: `getConsensusState(): Promise<ConsensusState>`

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup
- [x] Analyze current method in `cosmos-query-client.ts` (lines 218-221)
- [x] Confirm it uses `decodeResponse` (needs refactoring)
- [x] No parameters needed (method has no arguments)
- [x] Check response type: `ConsensusState` in `/types/responses/`
- [x] Review version-specific differences in adapters

### Phase 2: Response Type Refactoring
- [x] Create response type file: `/types/responses/common/consensus-state/consensus-state-response.ts`
- [x] Define TypeScript interface for `ConsensusStateResponse`
- [x] Handle complex structure:
  - [x] `roundState` object with consensus round details
  - [x] `peers` array of peer consensus states
- [x] Define nested interfaces:
  - [x] `RoundState` with height, round, step, etc.
  - [x] `PeerRoundState` for peer information
  - [x] `HeightVoteSet` for vote information
- [x] Create codec using `createCodec()` with proper converters:
  - [x] Number/BigInt conversions for heights and rounds
  - [x] Timestamp conversions for start times
  - [x] Array converters for peers and votes
  - [x] Complex nested object handling
- [x] Implement `createConsensusStateResponse()` function
- [x] Add decoder method to `ResponseDecoder` interface: `decodeConsensusState<T extends ConsensusStateResponse = ConsensusStateResponse>(response: unknown): T`
- [x] Use generics for flexibility in decoder method (see pattern in completed methods)
- [x] Implement `decodeConsensusState()` in `BaseAdapter`

### Phase 3: Request Type Refactoring
- [x] No request parameters needed (skip this phase)

### Phase 4: Update Query Client
- [x] Update `getConsensusState()` method to use:
  - [x] `this.protocolAdapter.decodeConsensusState(result)` instead of `decodeResponse`
- [x] Update imports to use index files

### Phase 5: Testing and Validation
- [x] Run TypeScript compiler for type checking
- [x] Test consensus state retrieval
- [x] Verify round state information
- [x] Check peer information is properly decoded

### Phase 6: Cleanup
- [x] Remove `CONSENSUS_STATE` case from `decodeResponse` switch statement
- [x] Remove unused imports
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments
- [ ] Document consensus state structure

## Notes
- No parameters needed for this method
- Returns current consensus round information
- Contains detailed peer consensus states
- Complex nested structure requires careful handling
