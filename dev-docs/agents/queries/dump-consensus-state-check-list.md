# Dump Consensus State Method Refactoring Checklist

## Method: `dumpConsensusState(): Promise<ConsensusStateDump>`

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup
- [x] Analyze current method in `cosmos-query-client.ts` (lines 223-226)
- [x] Confirm it uses `decodeResponse` (needs refactoring)
- [x] No parameters needed (method has no arguments)
- [x] Check response type: `ConsensusStateDump` in `/types/responses/`
- [x] Review version-specific differences in adapters

### Phase 2: Response Type Refactoring
- [x] Create response type file: `/types/responses/common/consensus/consensus-state-dump-response.ts`
- [x] Define TypeScript interface for `ConsensusStateDumpResponse`
- [x] Handle structure (likely more detailed than regular consensus state):
  - [x] Full consensus state dump
  - [x] Additional debugging information
  - [x] Raw state data
- [x] Create codec using `createCodec()` with proper converters:
  - [x] Handle all fields from the dump
  - [x] May need flexible handling for debug data
- [x] Implement `createConsensusStateDumpResponse()` function
- [x] Add decoder method to `ResponseDecoder` interface: `decodeDumpConsensusState<T extends ConsensusStateDumpResponse = ConsensusStateDumpResponse>(response: unknown): T`
- [x] Use generics for flexibility in decoder method (see pattern in completed methods)
- [x] Implement `decodeDumpConsensusState()` in `BaseAdapter`

### Phase 3: Request Type Refactoring
- [x] No request parameters needed (skip this phase)

### Phase 4: Update Query Client
- [x] Update `dumpConsensusState()` method to use:
  - [x] `this.protocolAdapter.decodeDumpConsensusState(result)` instead of `decodeResponse`
- [x] Update imports to use index files

### Phase 5: Testing and Validation
- [x] Run TypeScript compiler for type checking
- [x] Test consensus state dump retrieval (structure verified, runtime test blocked by dependencies)
- [x] Verify all debug information is captured (PeerState with nested roundState)
- [x] Compare with regular consensus state (dump includes peers array)

### Phase 6: Cleanup
- [x] Remove `DUMP_CONSENSUS_STATE` case from `decodeResponse` switch statement
- [x] Remove unused imports
- [x] Add JSDoc comments
- [x] Document differences from regular consensus state

## Notes
- No parameters needed for this method
- Returns more detailed/raw consensus information
- Used for debugging consensus issues
- May contain implementation-specific data
