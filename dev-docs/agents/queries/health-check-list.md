# Health Method Refactoring Checklist ✅

## Method: `getHealth(): Promise<HealthResult>`

**Status: COMPLETED** - This method has been successfully refactored as a simple example.

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup ✅
- [x] Analyzed method in `cosmos-query-client.ts` (lines 72-75)
- [x] Confirmed it uses specific `decodeHealth` method
- [x] No parameters needed (method has no arguments)
- [x] Response type: `HealthResult` in `/types/responses/`
- [x] No version-specific differences

### Phase 2: Response Type Refactoring ✅
- [x] Created response type file: `/types/responses/common/health/health-response.ts`
- [x] Defined TypeScript interface for `HealthResponse`:
  ```typescript
  export interface HealthResponse {
    // Empty interface - health check returns empty object on success
  }
  ```
- [x] Created minimal codec:
  ```typescript
  export const HealthResponseCodec = createCodec<HealthResponse>({});
  ```
- [x] Implemented `createHealthResponse()` function
- [x] Added decoder to `ResponseDecoder` interface: `decodeHealth<T extends HealthResponse = HealthResponse>(response: unknown): T`
- [x] Implemented in `BaseAdapter`:
  ```typescript
  decodeHealth<T extends HealthResponse = HealthResponse>(response: unknown): T {
    return createHealthResponse(response) as T;
  }
  ```

### Phase 3: Request Type Refactoring ✅
- [x] No request parameters needed (skipped)

### Phase 4: Update Query Client ✅
- [x] Updated method to use:
  ```typescript
  async getHealth(): Promise<HealthResult> {
    const result = await this.rpcClient.call(RpcMethod.HEALTH);
    return this.protocolAdapter.decodeHealth(result);
  }
  ```
- [x] Clean implementation without parameters

### Phase 5: Testing and Validation ✅
- [x] TypeScript compilation passes
- [x] Returns empty object on success
- [x] Throws error if node is unhealthy
- [x] Simple and reliable

### Phase 6: Cleanup ✅
- [x] Never used generic pattern
- [x] Minimal imports
- [x] Simple documentation
- [x] Clean implementation

## Implementation Details

### Response Structure
```typescript
// RPC Response (healthy node)
{}

// RPC Response (unhealthy node)
// Throws HTTP error or connection error

// Decoded TypeScript
{}
```

### Key Learnings
- Simplest possible refactoring example
- Health endpoint returns empty object on success
- Errors indicate unhealthy node
- No data transformation needed
- Good starting point for learning the pattern
