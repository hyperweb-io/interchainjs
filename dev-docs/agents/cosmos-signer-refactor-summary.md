# Cosmos Signer Refactoring Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Type Definitions (`types.ts`)

Added new interfaces to support both Auth and OfflineSigner patterns:

- **Auth**: Interface for private key-based authentication
- **AccountData**: Account information returned by offline signers
- **DirectSignResponse**: Response from direct signing
- **AminoSignResponse**: Response from amino signing
- **OfflineSigner**: Base interface for external signers
- **OfflineDirectSigner**: Interface for direct (protobuf) signing
- **OfflineAminoSigner**: Interface for amino (JSON) signing

### 2. Created WalletAdapter (`wallet-adapter.ts`)

A new adapter class that:
- Accepts either Auth or OfflineSigner as input
- Implements the CosmosWallet interface
- Handles account retrieval from both sources
- Manages public key extraction
- Provides signing capabilities based on input type

### 3. Updated BaseCosmosSignerImpl (`base-signer.ts`)

- Changed constructor to accept `Auth | OfflineSigner` instead of `CosmosWallet`
- Uses WalletAdapter internally to maintain compatibility
- Stores the original authOrSigner for reference

### 4. Updated DirectSigner (`direct-signer.ts`)

- Updated constructor signature
- Enhanced sign() method to handle both Auth and OfflineDirectSigner
- Added type guard `isOfflineDirectSigner()`
- Separate signing logic for Auth vs OfflineDirectSigner

### 5. Updated AminoSigner (`amino-signer.ts`)

- Updated constructor signature
- Enhanced sign() method to handle both Auth and OfflineAminoSigner
- Added type guard `isOfflineAminoSigner()`
- Separate signing logic for Auth vs OfflineAminoSigner

### 6. Enhanced SimpleWallet (`simple-wallet.ts`)

- Added hdPath property
- Added `toAuth()` method to convert wallet to Auth interface
- Added static `fromAuth()` method to create wallet from Auth

### 7. Updated Exports (`index.ts`)

- Added export for wallet-adapter

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Backward Compatibility**: The WalletAdapter ensures existing code continues to work
2. **Type Safety**: All interfaces are properly typed with TypeScript
3. **Flexibility**: Supports both private key and external wallet scenarios
4. **Security**: OfflineSigner pattern keeps private keys secure in external wallets
5. **Simplicity**: Clean API that's easy to use for both patterns

## Testing Considerations

The implementation supports four main workflows:
1. Direct signing with Auth (private key included)
2. Amino signing with Auth (private key included)
3. Direct signing with OfflineDirectSigner (no private key)
4. Amino signing with OfflineAminoSigner (no private key)

## Build Issues

There are some build errors related to missing module dependencies in the monorepo structure. These are pre-existing issues not caused by the refactoring.
