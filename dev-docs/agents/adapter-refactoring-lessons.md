# Adapter Refactoring Lessons Learned

## What Worked Well

### 1. Adapter Type System
- The new `ICosmosProtocolAdapter` interface that combines `IProtocolAdapter` and `ResponseDecoder` is a good design
- Generic methods with extends constraints pattern: `<T extends ResponseType = ResponseType>` provides type safety while maintaining flexibility
- Removing the generic `decodeResponse` method in favor of specific decoder method calls improves type safety

### 2. Method Implementation Pattern
Good example of a clean decoder implementation:

```typescript
decodeAbciInfo<T extends AbciInfoResponse = AbciInfoResponse>(response: unknown): T {
  const resp = response as Record<string, unknown>;
  const data = (resp.response || resp) as Record<string, unknown>;
  return createAbciInfoResponse({
    data: data.data as string | undefined,
    lastBlockHeight: this.apiToNumber(data.last_block_height as string | null | undefined),
    lastBlockAppHash: this.maybeFromBase64(data.last_block_app_hash as string | null | undefined)
  }) as T;
}
```

Key aspects:
- Proper type casting from `unknown` to `Record<string, unknown>`
- Using creator functions (`createAbciInfoResponse`) for type-safe object construction
- Clear property extraction with appropriate type assertions
- Final `as T` assertion for generic return type

## What Needs Improvement

### 1. Nested Type Decoding
**Problem**: Complex nested types are decoded using private methods within adapters, making the code messy and hard to maintain.

**Solutions to consider**:
- Create dedicated type definitions for all nested structures
- Implement creator functions for each type (like `createAbciInfoResponse`)
- Consider a separate decoder utility module for complex nested structures
- Use a more structured approach for type transformations

### 2. Type Organization
**Problem**: Response and request type definitions are crowded in two large files (`types/responses.ts` and `types/requests.ts`).

**Solutions to consider**:
- Reorganize into a folder structure:
  ```
  types/
    requests/
      abci.ts
      block.ts
      tx.ts
      consensus.ts
      ...
    responses/
      abci.ts
      block.ts
      tx.ts
      consensus.ts
      ...
    index.ts (re-exports)
  ```
- Each file contains related types and their creator functions
- Improves maintainability and discoverability

## Recommended Approach for Next Iteration

1. **Start with type reorganization**: Create the folder structure and move types into individual files
2. **Implement creator functions**: For each response type, create a corresponding creator function that handles type construction
3. **Extract nested decoders**: Move complex nested type decoding logic into utility functions or the creator functions themselves
4. **Simplify adapter methods**: With creator functions in place, adapter methods become much cleaner and focus only on data extraction and transformation

## Example of Improved Pattern

```typescript
// In types/responses/abci.ts
export interface AbciInfoResponse {
  data?: string;
  lastBlockHeight: number;
  lastBlockAppHash: Uint8Array;
}

export function createAbciInfoResponse(params: {
  data?: string;
  lastBlockHeight: number;
  lastBlockAppHash: Uint8Array;
}): AbciInfoResponse {
  return {
    data: params.data,
    lastBlockHeight: params.lastBlockHeight,
    lastBlockAppHash: params.lastBlockAppHash
  };
}

// In adapter
decodeAbciInfo<T extends AbciInfoResponse = AbciInfoResponse>(response: unknown): T {
  const resp = response as Record<string, unknown>;
  const data = (resp.response || resp) as Record<string, unknown>;
  return createAbciInfoResponse({
    data: data.data as string | undefined,
    lastBlockHeight: this.apiToNumber(data.last_block_height as string | null | undefined),
    lastBlockAppHash: this.maybeFromBase64(data.last_block_app_hash as string | null | undefined)
  }) as T;
}
```

This pattern provides:
- Type safety through creator functions
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier testing and maintenance
- Consistent approach across all decoders
