## Core Concepts

### 1. Mnemonic Phrases (Seed Phrases)

**Common Aspects Across All Chains:**
- Based on BIP39 standard (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 39)
- Typically 12, 15, 18, 21, or 24 words from a standardized wordlist
- Human-readable representation of entropy
- Can be converted to a seed through PBKDF2 with 2048 iterations
- Optional passphrase support (25th word)

**Chain-Specific Details:**

| Aspect | Bitcoin | Ethereum | Cosmos |
|--------|---------|----------|---------|
| Standard | BIP39 | BIP39 | BIP39 |
| Common Length | 12-24 words | 12-24 words | 24 words |
| Derivation Path | BIP44: m/44'/0'/0'/0/0 | BIP44: m/44'/60'/0'/0/0 | BIP44: m/44'/118'/0'/0/0 |
| Wordlist | 2048 words | 2048 words | 2048 words |

### 2. Private Keys

**Common Aspects:**
- 256-bit random number (32 bytes)
- Must be kept secret

| Prefix | 1 (P2PKH), 3 (P2SH), bc1 (Bech32) | 0x | cosmos1, osmo1, etc. |
| Checksum | 4 bytes (Base58), BCH (Bech32) | EIP-55 (mixed case) | Bech32 checksum |

## Common Cryptographic Flow

```
Entropy → Mnemonic → Seed → Master Key → Child Keys → Public Key → Address
```

### Detailed Flow:

1. **Entropy Generation**
   - Random 128-256 bits
   - Converted to mnemonic words

2. **Seed Generation**
   - Mnemonic + optional passphrase
   - PBKDF2-SHA512 with 2048 iterations
   - Results in 512-bit seed

3. **HD Key Derivation**
   - Master key from seed
   - Child keys using BIP32
   - Hardened and non-hardened derivation

4. **Public Key Generation**
   - Private key × G (generator point)
   - Elliptic curve: secp256k1

5. **Address Generation** (chain-specific)
   - Traditional approach: Hash public key → Add network identifier → Encode with checksum
   - Modern approach: Some chains (e.g., Solana) use the public key directly as the address
   - Not all blockchains have a separate address concept

## Key Abstractions

### 1. Universal Concepts

**Private Key Abstraction:**
- **Purpose**: Authorization and ownership proof
- **Properties**: Secret, random, deterministic signing
- **Format**: 256-bit number, various encodings

**Public Key Abstraction:**
- **Purpose**: Identity and signature verification
- **Properties**: Derived from private key, shareable
- **Format**: EC point, compressed/uncompressed

**Address Abstraction:**
- **Purpose**: Human-readable recipient identifier
- **Properties**: 
  - Traditional: Derived from public key via hashing, includes error detection
  - Modern: May be the public key itself (e.g., Solana)
- **Format**: Encoded string with network information
- **Optional**: Not all chains use separate addresses from public keys

### 2. Cross-Chain Compatibility

**Shared Standards:**
- BIP39 for mnemonics
- BIP32 for HD wallets
- BIP44 for account structure
- secp256k1 elliptic curve

**Differences:**
- Address encoding formats
- Network identifiers
- Checksum algorithms
- Default key compression

### 3. Security Considerations

**Common Security Model:**
- Private key controls funds
- Public key/address can be shared
- Mnemonic backup for recovery
- HD wallet for key management

**Best Practices:**
- Never share private keys or mnemonics
- Use hardware wallets for key storage
- Verify addresses before transactions
- Keep multiple secure backups

## Conceptual Architecture

### Separation of Concerns

Modern blockchain wallet architecture follows a clear separation of concerns principle:

1. **Wallet Layer**: Acts as a secure container for cryptographic keys
   - Manages multiple private keys derived from a single seed
   - Handles key derivation following HD wallet standards
   - Provides signing capabilities without exposing private keys

2. **Account Layer**: Represents public-facing blockchain identities
   - Contains only public information (addresses, public keys)
   - No access to private keys or sensitive data
   - Enables safe sharing of account information

3. **Key Management Layer**: Handles the cryptographic operations
   - Private keys for signing transactions
   - Public keys for verification
   - Address generation based on chain-specific rules

### Design Principles

#### 1. **Configuration-Driven Architecture**

The system uses a configuration-driven approach where each component (private keys, public keys, addresses) has its own configuration. This allows:

- **Algorithm Flexibility**: Support for different cryptographic algorithms (secp256k1, ed25519)
- **Hash Function Variability**: Different chains use different hash functions
- **Encoding Strategies**: Each blockchain has unique address encoding rules

#### 2. **Strategy Pattern for Address Generation**

Address generation follows the strategy pattern, where each blockchain has its own strategy that encapsulates:

- **Public Key Preprocessing**: Some chains require uncompressed keys (Ethereum) while others use compressed keys (Bitcoin, Cosmos)
- **Hash Function Application**: The specific sequence of hash functions (e.g., SHA256→RIPEMD160 for Bitcoin/Cosmos, Keccak256 for Ethereum)
- **Encoding Rules**: How the final address is formatted (Bech32, Base58, Hex)
- **Checksum Logic**: Chain-specific checksum algorithms

#### 3. **Abstraction Layers**

The architecture provides multiple abstraction layers:

- **Cryptographic Primitives**: Abstract representations of keys and cryptographic operations
- **Chain-Specific Logic**: Isolated in strategies and configurations
- **User-Facing API**: Simple, consistent interface regardless of underlying blockchain

#### 4. **Type Safety and Flexibility**

The design balances type safety with flexibility:

- **String Presets**: Simple strings like 'secp256k1' or 'cosmos' for common configurations
- **Custom Objects**: Full control through custom algorithm and strategy implementations
- **Internal Resolution**: The system internally resolves strings to their corresponding implementations

## Implementation Strategy

### Key Derivation Flow

The cryptographic flow follows a deterministic path:

```
Mnemonic → Seed → HD Derivation → Private Keys → Public Keys → Addresses
```

This ensures that the same mnemonic always generates the same keys and addresses, enabling wallet recovery from just the seed phrase.

### Multi-Chain Considerations

When implementing multi-chain support, consider:

1. **Algorithm Compatibility**: While secp256k1 is common, some chains support additional algorithms
2. **Hash Function Requirements**: Each chain may require specific hash functions
3. **Address Format Differences**: Encoding, checksums, and prefixes vary significantly
4. **Key Compression**: Some chains require compressed keys, others uncompressed

### Security Best Practices

1. **Key Isolation**: Private keys should never be exposed outside their secure container
2. **Minimal Surface Area**: Limit the number of methods that handle private keys
3. **Clear Boundaries**: Separate public information (accounts) from private information (keys)
4. **Configuration Validation**: Verify configurations before key generation

### Address Generation Patterns

Each blockchain follows a specific pattern for address generation:

1. **Cosmos Ecosystem**:
   - Process: Public Key → SHA256 → RIPEMD160 → Bech32 encoding
   - Result: Human-readable addresses like `cosmos1...`, `osmo1...`
   - Benefits: Error detection, human-readable prefixes

2. **Ethereum**:
   - Process: Uncompressed Public Key → Keccak256 → Last 20 bytes
   - Result: Hexadecimal addresses like `0x...`
   - Checksum: EIP-55 mixed-case encoding

3. **Bitcoin**:
   - Process: Similar to Cosmos but with Base58Check encoding
   - Multiple formats: P2PKH (1...), P2SH (3...), Bech32 (bc1...)
   - Version bytes determine address type

## Practical Applications

### Multi-Chain Wallet Architecture

A modern wallet needs to support multiple blockchains while maintaining security and usability. The architecture achieves this through:

1. **Unified Seed Management**: One mnemonic can generate keys for all supported chains
2. **Chain-Specific Configurations**: Each blockchain has its own configuration for algorithms and address generation
3. **Consistent Interface**: Developers work with the same API regardless of the underlying blockchain

### Use Cases

1. **Cross-Chain Applications**: 
   - DeFi platforms that operate across multiple chains
   - Portfolio managers tracking assets on different blockchains
   - Bridge applications facilitating cross-chain transfers

2. **Wallet Recovery**:
   - Users can recover all their accounts from a single mnemonic
   - HD paths ensure deterministic key generation
   - Support for multiple address formats from the same seed

3. **Developer Tools**:
   - Blockchain explorers that need to validate addresses
   - Testing frameworks requiring key generation
   - SDK development for blockchain applications

## Future Considerations

### Emerging Standards

1. **New Algorithms**: As quantum computing advances, new cryptographic algorithms may be needed
2. **Chain Innovations**: New blockchains may introduce novel address formats
3. **Interoperability**: Standards for cross-chain communication and identity

### Extensibility

The architecture is designed to accommodate:
- New cryptographic algorithms through the algorithm interface
- Additional blockchains through the strategy pattern
- Enhanced security features without breaking existing implementations

Understanding the cryptographic foundations of blockchain technology reveals the elegant simplicity underlying these complex systems. Despite their differences, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cosmos share fundamental principles that enable secure, decentralized transactions.

The proposed architecture leverages these commonalities while respecting chain-specific requirements, providing a robust foundation for multi-chain applications.
