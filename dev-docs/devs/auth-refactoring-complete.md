# Auth Refactoring Complete

## Summary

Successfully moved chain-specific authentication implementations from `packages/auth` to their respective network packages. The project builds successfully.

## What Was Done

### 1. Moved Auth Strategies
- ✅ Moved `cosmos.ts` strategy → `networks/cosmos/src/auth/strategy.ts`
- ✅ Moved `ethereum.ts` strategy → `networks/ethereum/src/auth/strategy.ts`
- ✅ Moved `injective.ts` strategy → `networks/injective/src/auth/strategy.ts`

### 2. Moved Config Builders
- ✅ Moved `createCosmosConfig` → `networks/cosmos/src/auth/config.ts`
- ✅ Moved `createEthereumConfig` → `networks/ethereum/src/auth/config.ts`
- ✅ Moved `createInjectiveConfig` → `networks/injective/src/auth/config.ts`

### 3. Updated Auth Package
- ✅ Implemented registry pattern in `packages/auth/src/strategies/index.ts`
- ✅ Created generic `createWalletConfig` in `packages/auth/src/config/builders.ts`
- ✅ Removed hardcoded chain-specific implementations

### 4. Resolved Dependencies
- ✅ Removed circular dependency: `@interchainjs/auth` from cosmos package
- ✅ Removed circular dependency: `@interchainjs/auth` from injective package
- ✅ Added `bech32@1.1.4` to cosmos package
- ✅ Moved `bech32@2.0.0` to dependencies in injective package

### 5. Updated Exports
- ✅ Added auth exports to `networks/cosmos/src/index.ts`
- ✅ Added auth exports to `networks/ethereum/src/index.ts`
- ✅ Added auth exports to `networks/injective/src/index.ts`

## Build Status

✅ **Build Successful** - All packages compile without errors

## Known Issues

1. **Type Warnings**: Cosmos package has pre-existing type compatibility issues with `IAccount` interface (not related to this refactoring)
2. **Outdated Tests**: Some injective tests reference non-existent auth classes (pre-existing issue)

## Next Steps

For users of the library:
1. Update imports from `@interchainjs/auth` to respective network packages
2. Register strategies if using string-based strategy names with the registry

For maintainers:
1. Update the outdated injective tests
2. Consider fixing the cosmos type compatibility issues in a future release
3. Add strategy registration in network package initialization
