## TLDR

Deploy

```sh
pnpm starship
```

Run Tests

```sh
pnpm starship:test
```

Teardown

```sh
pnpm starship:stop
```

Port fording manually if needed
```sh
kubectl port-forward pods/ethereum-1337-0 8545:8545
```

Get chain id from node
```sh
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_chainId","params":[],"id":1}' \
  http://localhost:8545/
```

Get balance:
```sh
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getBalance","params":["0x7e5f4552091a69125d5dfcb7b8c2659029395bdf", "latest"],"id":1}' \
  http://localhost:8545
```

use ws to get latest block height:
```sh
wscat -c ws://127.0.0.1:8546
```
and then paste:
```
{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "eth_subscribe", "params": ["newHeads"]}
```

## 1. Installation

Inorder to get started with starship, one needs to install the following

- `kubectl`: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/
- `kind`: https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation
- `helm`: https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/

Note: To make the process easy we have a simple command that will try and install dependencies
so that you dont have to.

```bash
pnpm starship setup
```

This command will

- check (and install) if your system has all the dependencies needed to run the e2e tests wtih Starship
- fetch the helm charts for Starship

## 2. Connect to a kubernetes cluster

Inorder to set up the infrastructure, for Starship, we need access to a kubernetes cluster.
One can either perform connect to a

- remote cluster in a managed kubernetes service
- use kubernetes desktop to spin up a cluster
- use kind to create a local cluster on local machine

To make this easier we have a handy command which will create a local kind cluster and give you access
to a kubernetes cluster locally.

NOTE: Resources constraint on local machine will affect the performance of Starship spinup time

```bash
pnpm starship setup-kind
```

Run the following command to check connection to a k8s cluster

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

## 3. Start Starship

Now with the dependencies and a kubernetes cluster in handy, we can proceed with creating the mini-cosmos ecosystem

Run

```bash
pnpm starship deploy
```

We use the config file `configs/config.yaml` as the genesis file to define the topology of the e2e test infra. Change it as required

Note: Spinup will take some time, while you wait for the system, can check the progress in another tab with `kubectl get pods`

## 4. Run the tests

We have everything we need, our desired infrastructure is now running as intended, now we can run
our end-to-end tests.

Run

```bash
npm run starship:test
```

## 5. Stop the infra

The tests should be ideompotent, so the tests can be run multiple times (which is recommeded), since the time to spinup is still high (around 5 to 10 mins).

Once the state of the mini-cosmos is corrupted, you can stop the deployments with

```bash
npm run starship clean
```

Which will

- Stop port-forwarding the traffic to your local
- Delete all the helm charts deployed

## 6. Cleanup kind (optional)

If you are using kind for your kubernetes cluster, you can delete it with

```bash
pnpm starship clean-kind
```
