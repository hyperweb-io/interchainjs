## TLDR

Deploy

```sh
# setup helm/starship
yarn starship setup

# deploy starship, the command will wait until all pods are running
yarn starship:all

# sanity check
yarn starship get-pods
```

Run Tests

```sh
# test
yarn starship:test
```

Teardown

```sh
# stop port forwarding (done by clean() too)
# yarn starship stop-ports

# stop ports and delete & remove helm chart
yarn starship:clean
```

## 1. Installation

Inorder to get started with starship, one needs to install the following

- `kubectl`: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/
- `kind`: https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation
- `helm`: https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/

Note: To make the process easy we have a simple command that will try and install dependencies
so that you dont have to.

```bash
yarn starship setup
```

This command will

- check (and install) if your system has all the dependencies needed to run the e2e tests wtih Starship
- fetch the helm charts for Starship

## 2. Connect to a kubernetes cluster

Inorder to set up the infrastructure, for Starship, we need access to a kubernetes cluster.
One can either perform connect to a

- remote cluster in a managed kubernetes service
- use kubernetes desktop to spin up a cluster
- use kind to create a local cluster on local machine

To make this easier we have a handy command which will create a local kind cluster and give you access
to a kubernetes cluster locally.

NOTE: Resources constraint on local machine will affect the performance of Starship spinup time

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

## 3. Start Starship

Now with the dependencies and a kubernetes cluster in handy, we can proceed with creating the mini-cosmos ecosystem

Run

```bash
yarn starship:all
# or
yarn starship start
```

We use the config file `configs/config.yaml` as the genesis file to define the topology of the e2e test infra. Change it as required

Note: Spinup will take some time, while you wait for the system, can check the progress in another tab with `kubectl get pods`

## 4. Run the tests

We have everything we need, our desired infrastructure is now running as intended, now we can run
our end-to-end tests.

Run

```bash
yarn starship:test
```

### Available Tests

The test suite includes comprehensive end-to-end tests covering Injective Protocol functionality with Ethereum-compatible addressing and specialized Cosmos SDK features:

#### Staking Tests (`staking.test.ts`)

Tests Injective staking operations with Ethereum-style addressing and Cosmos SDK delegation:

- **Validator Discovery**: Queries and selects active validators for delegation using Injective RPC
- **Token Delegation**: Tests delegating INJ tokens to validators using DirectSigner
- **Delegation Verification**: Verifies delegation amounts and validator assignments
- **Ethereum HD Path**: Uses Ethereum-style HD path (`m/44'/60'/0'/0/0`) for Injective compatibility
- **Key Scenarios**:
  - Querying bonded validators and selecting by stake amount
  - Delegating tokens using Injective-specific signer configuration
  - Verifying delegation balances match expected amounts
  - Testing with EthSecp256k1HDWallet for Ethereum-compatible key derivation

**Injective-Specific Patterns**:

- Uses `EthSecp256k1HDWallet` instead of standard Cosmos wallets
- Implements `queryClientWrapper` pattern to fix prototype chain issues
- Uses Ethereum HD path for address derivation while maintaining Cosmos SDK compatibility
- Applies Injective-specific signer configuration with compact signature format
- Includes proper error handling for Injective network peculiarities

#### Token Transfer Tests (`token.test.ts`)

Comprehensive testing of INJ token transfers and IBC functionality:

- **Native INJ Transfers**: Tests transferring native INJ tokens between accounts
- **IBC Transfers**: Tests cross-chain token transfers from Injective to Cosmos Hub
- **Ethereum Addressing**: Uses Ethereum-style addresses with `inj` prefix
- **Balance Verification**: Verifies token balances before and after transfers
- **Key Scenarios**:
  - Sending INJ tokens between accounts with balance verification
  - Cross-chain IBC transfers to Cosmos Hub with denomination tracking
  - Testing with multiple wallet instances and address derivations
  - Verifying IBC token receipt and proper denomination handling

**Injective-Specific Patterns**:

- Uses `EthSecp256k1HDWallet` with Ethereum HD path for sender accounts
- Switches to standard Cosmos HD path for Cosmos Hub recipients
- Implements `queryClientWrapper` pattern for proper method binding
- Uses Injective-specific signer configuration with proper defaults
- Includes network-specific timeout and error handling

#### Governance Tests (`gov.test.ts`)

Tests Injective governance functionality including proposals and voting:

- **Proposal Submission**: Tests submitting text proposals to the Injective governance module
- **Voting Process**: Tests voting on proposals with different vote options
- **Validator Delegation**: Tests staking INJ tokens to gain voting power
- **Proposal Status Tracking**: Tests querying proposal status and vote tallies
- **Key Scenarios**:
  - Submitting governance proposals with proper deposits
  - Voting on proposals using both DirectSigner and AminoSigner
  - Tracking proposal lifecycle from submission to completion
  - Verifying vote recording and tally calculations with Injective-specific parameters

**Injective-Specific Patterns**:

- Uses dual signer setup (DirectSigner and AminoSigner) for compatibility testing
- Implements proper encoder and converter registration for Injective message types
- Uses `EthSecp256k1HDWallet` with Ethereum HD path for governance participants
- Applies Injective-specific configuration for proposal parameters and voting periods
- Includes proper handling of Injective governance module differences

#### Setup Tests (`setup.test.ts`)

Infrastructure and environment setup tests for Injective Protocol:

- **Environment Validation**: Tests that the Starship environment is properly configured for Injective
- **Chain Connectivity**: Tests connectivity to Injective RPC endpoints
- **Account Funding**: Tests faucet functionality for INJ token funding
- **Wallet Compatibility**: Tests Ethereum-style wallet compatibility with Injective
- **Key Scenarios**:
  - Verifying Starship pods are running and healthy for Injective
  - Testing RPC endpoint accessibility and proper responses
  - Validating test account creation with Ethereum-style addressing
  - Ensuring proper chain configuration and genesis state for Injective Protocol

**Injective-Specific Patterns**:

- Validates Ethereum-compatible address generation with `inj` prefix
- Tests proper integration between Ethereum-style wallets and Cosmos SDK
- Verifies Injective-specific RPC endpoints and query methods
- Ensures proper configuration for Injective's unique protocol features
- Tests compatibility between Ethereum tooling and Cosmos SDK functionality

## 5. Stop the infra

The tests should be ideompotent, so the tests can be run multiple times (which is recommeded), since the time to spinup is still high (around 5 to 10 mins).

Once the state of the mini-cosmos is corrupted, you can stop the deployments with

```bash
yarn starship:clean
```

Which will

- Stop port-forwarding the traffic to your local
- Delete all the helm charts deployed
