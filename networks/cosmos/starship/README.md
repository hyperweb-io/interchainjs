## TLDR

Deploy

```sh
# setup helm/starship
yarn starship setup

# deploy starship, the command will wait until all pods are running
yarn starship:all

# sanity check
yarn starship get-pods
```

Run Tests

```sh
# test
yarn starship:test
```

Teardown

```sh
# stop port forwarding (done by clean() too)
# yarn starship stop-ports

# stop ports and delete & remove helm chart
yarn starship:clean
```

## 1. Installation

Inorder to get started with starship, one needs to install the following

- `kubectl`: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/
- `kind`: https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation
- `helm`: https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/

Note: To make the process easy we have a simple command that will try and install dependencies
so that you dont have to.

```bash
yarn starship setup
```

This command will

- check (and install) if your system has all the dependencies needed to run the e2e tests wtih Starship
- fetch the helm charts for Starship

## 2. Connect to a kubernetes cluster

Inorder to set up the infrastructure, for Starship, we need access to a kubernetes cluster.
One can either perform connect to a

- remote cluster in a managed kubernetes service
- use kubernetes desktop to spin up a cluster
- use kind to create a local cluster on local machine

To make this easier we have a handy command which will create a local kind cluster and give you access
to a kubernetes cluster locally.

NOTE: Resources constraint on local machine will affect the performance of Starship spinup time

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

## 3. Start Starship

Now with the dependencies and a kubernetes cluster in handy, we can proceed with creating the mini-cosmos ecosystem

Run

```bash
yarn starship:all
# or
yarn starship start
```

We use the config file `configs/config.yaml` as the genesis file to define the topology of the e2e test infra. Change it as required

Note: Spinup will take some time, while you wait for the system, can check the progress in another tab with `kubectl get pods`

## 4. Run the tests

We have everything we need, our desired infrastructure is now running as intended, now we can run
our end-to-end tests.

Run

```bash
yarn starship:test
```

### Available Tests

The test suite includes comprehensive end-to-end tests covering various Cosmos SDK functionalities:

#### Authorization Tests (`authz.test.ts`)

- **Key Scenarios**:
  - Granting limited send authorization with spending caps
  - Granting generic authorization for voting
  - Executing send transactions through authorization
  - Verifying authorization limits are enforced
  - Cleaning up authorizations by revoking them

#### Staking Tests (`staking.test.ts`)

Tests Cosmos staking operations including delegation and validator interactions:

- **Validator Discovery**: Queries and selects active validators for delegation
- **Token Delegation**: Tests delegating tokens to validators using different signing modes
- **Delegation Verification**: Verifies delegation amounts and validator assignments
- **Key Scenarios**:

  - Delegating tokens using default, direct, and amino signing modes
  - Verifying delegation balances match expected amounts
  - Testing multiple delegation transactions to the same validator

#### Token Transfer Tests (`token.test.ts`)

Comprehensive testing of token transfers within and across chains:

- **Direct Mode Transfers**: Tests token transfers using direct (protobuf) signing
- **Amino Mode Transfers**: Tests token transfers using amino (JSON) signing
- **WebSocket Event Monitoring**: Tests real-time transaction event monitoring via WebSocket
- **IBC Transfers**: Tests cross-chain token transfers using IBC protocol
- **Key Scenarios**:
  - Sending OSMO tokens between accounts with balance verification
  - Monitoring transfer events in real-time using WebSocket subscriptions
  - Cross-chain IBC transfers from Osmosis to Cosmos Hub
  - Verifying IBC token receipt and denomination tracing

#### Governance Tests (`gov.test.ts`)

Tests Cosmos governance functionality including proposals and voting:

- **Proposal Submission**: Tests submitting text proposals to the governance module
- **Voting Process**: Tests voting on proposals with different vote options
- **Proposal Status Tracking**: Tests querying proposal status and vote tallies
- **Validator Delegation**: Tests staking tokens to gain voting power
- **Key Scenarios**:
  - Submitting governance proposals with proper deposits
  - Voting on proposals using different signers and vote options
  - Tracking proposal lifecycle from submission to completion
  - Verifying vote recording and tally calculations

#### Broadcast Tests (`broadcast.test.ts`)

Tests different transaction broadcasting methods and RPC functionality:

- **Async Broadcasting**: Tests `broadcastTxAsync` for fire-and-forget transactions
- **Sync Broadcasting**: Tests `broadcastTxSync` for immediate response transactions
- **Commit Broadcasting**: Tests `broadcastTxCommit` for confirmed transactions
- **Error Handling**: Tests proper error responses for invalid transactions
- **Key Scenarios**:
  - Testing different broadcast modes with various transaction types
  - Verifying proper RPC response formats
  - Handling invalid transactions and signature errors
  - Testing broadcast method performance characteristics

#### Query Client Tests (`query-client.test.ts`)

Tests the Cosmos query client functionality and RPC endpoint interactions:

- **RPC Connectivity**: Tests connection to Cosmos RPC endpoints
- **Query Methods**: Tests various query methods for different modules
- **Adapter Functionality**: Tests protocol adapters for different Cosmos versions
- **Error Handling**: Tests proper error handling for failed queries
- **Key Scenarios**:
  - Testing query client initialization and connection
  - Verifying query responses match expected formats
  - Testing different RPC adapter implementations
  - Handling network errors and timeouts gracefully

#### Signer Method Tests (`signer-methods.test.ts`)

Tests different signing methods and signer configurations:

- **Direct Signing**: Tests protobuf-based transaction signing
- **Amino Signing**: Tests JSON-based legacy transaction signing
- **Signer Configuration**: Tests various signer configuration options
- **Multi-Signature**: Tests multi-signature transaction workflows
- **Key Scenarios**:
  - Comparing direct vs amino signing results
  - Testing signer configuration with different parameters
  - Verifying signature formats and compatibility
  - Testing multi-signature transaction creation and signing

#### Setup Tests (`setup.test.ts`)

Infrastructure and environment setup tests:

- **Environment Validation**: Tests that the Starship environment is properly configured
- **Chain Connectivity**: Tests connectivity to all configured chains
- **Account Funding**: Tests faucet functionality for test account funding
- **Service Health**: Tests that all required services are running and accessible
- **Key Scenarios**:
  - Verifying Starship pods are running and healthy
  - Testing RPC endpoint accessibility
  - Validating test account creation and funding
  - Ensuring proper chain configuration and genesis state

## 5. Stop the infra

The tests should be ideompotent, so the tests can be run multiple times (which is recommeded), since the time to spinup is still high (around 5 to 10 mins).

Once the state of the mini-cosmos is corrupted, you can stop the deployments with

```bash
yarn starship:clean
```

Which will

- Stop port-forwarding the traffic to your local
- Delete all the helm charts deployed
