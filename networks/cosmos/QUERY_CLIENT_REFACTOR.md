# Cosmos Query Client Refactoring Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the work done to align the Cosmos query client with CosmJS's structure and response formats.

## Completed Work

### 1. Analysis of CosmJS Structure
- Cloned and analyzed the CosmJS repository to understand their implementation patterns
- Identified key differences in response structures:
  - CosmJS uses typed response interfaces with specific field names
  - Uses camelCase for field names (e.g., `blockHeight`, `totalCount`)
  - Response types are strongly typed with readonly properties
  - Uses `Uint8Array` for binary data instead of strings
  - Uses `Date` objects for timestamps
  - Uses `bigint` for large numbers

### 2. Created New Type Definitions
Created new type files aligned with CosmJS structure:

- `/src/query/types/requests.ts` - Request types for all RPC methods
- `/src/query/types/responses.ts` - Response types matching CosmJS format
- `/src/query/types/adaptor.ts` - Adaptor functions to transform raw RPC responses
- `/src/query/types/index.ts` - Index file for exports

### 3. Created Response Transformer
- `/src/query/response-transformer.ts` - Comprehensive transformer to convert existing responses to CosmJS format
- Handles all data type conversions:
  - Hex strings to Uint8Array
  - Base64 strings to Uint8Array
  - String timestamps to Date objects
  - String numbers to number/bigint types

### 4. Updated Query Client
- Added `QueryClientOptions` interface to support optional CosmJS response format
- Client can now be configured to return either legacy or CosmJS-compatible responses

### 5. Created Comprehensive Tests
- `/rpc/query-client.test.ts` - Full test suite covering all query methods
- Tests verify:
  - All basic info methods (status, abci_info, health, net_info)
  - All block query methods (block, block_by_hash, block_results, etc.)
  - All transaction query methods (tx, tx_search, unconfirmed_txs, etc.)
  - All chain query methods (validators, consensus_params, genesis)
  - ABCI query functionality
  - Error handling for invalid inputs
  - Response format validation

## Test Results
All 27 tests pass successfully against the Osmosis RPC endpoint (https://rpc.osmosis.zone/):
- Connection Management: 2 tests ✓
- Basic Info Methods: 4 tests ✓
- Block Query Methods: 9 tests ✓
- Transaction Query Methods: 4 tests ✓
- Chain Query Methods: 3 tests ✓
- ABCI Query Methods: 1 test ✓
- Error Handling: 4 tests ✓

## Key Findings

### Response Format Differences
1. **Binary Data**: CosmJS uses `Uint8Array` while current implementation uses hex/base64 strings
2. **Timestamps**: CosmJS uses `Date` objects while current implementation uses ISO strings
3. **Numbers**: CosmJS uses `number` for heights and `bigint` for large values
4. **Field Names**: CosmJS uses consistent camelCase naming
5. **Optional Fields**: CosmJS marks optional fields explicitly with `?`

### Implementation Considerations
- The current implementation is functional and all tests pass
- To fully align with CosmJS would require breaking changes to the API
- A migration path could be provided using the `useCosmjsResponses` option

## Recommendations

1. **Gradual Migration**: Use the transformer functions to provide CosmJS-compatible responses as an opt-in feature
2. **Version Strategy**: Consider releasing a new major version with CosmJS-aligned responses
3. **Documentation**: Update documentation to show both response formats
4. **Type Safety**: The new type definitions provide better type safety and IDE support

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `/src/query/types/requests.ts`
- `/src/query/types/responses.ts`
- `/src/query/types/adaptor.ts`
- `/src/query/types/index.ts`
- `/src/query/response-transformer.ts`
- `/rpc/query-client.test.ts` (updated with comprehensive tests)

### Modified Files
- `/src/query/cosmos-query-client.ts` (added options support)

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve the proposed changes
2. Decide on migration strategy (opt-in vs breaking change)
3. Update documentation with examples
4. Consider adding more helper functions for common use cases
5. Plan deprecation of legacy response format if needed
