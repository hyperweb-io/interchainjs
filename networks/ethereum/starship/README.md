## TLDR

Deploy

```sh
# setup helm/starship
yarn starship setup

# deploy starship, the command will wait until all pods are running
yarn starship:all

# sanity check
yarn starship get-pods
```

Run Tests

```sh
# test
yarn starship:test
```

Teardown

```sh
# stop port forwarding (done by clean() too)
# yarn starship stop-ports

# stop ports and delete & remove helm chart
yarn starship:clean
```

## 1. Installation

Inorder to get started with starship, one needs to install the following

- `kubectl`: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/
- `kind`: https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation
- `helm`: https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/

Note: To make the process easy we have a simple command that will try and install dependencies
so that you dont have to.

```bash
yarn starship setup
```

This command will

- check (and install) if your system has all the dependencies needed to run the e2e tests wtih Starship
- fetch the helm charts for Starship

## 2. Connect to a kubernetes cluster

Inorder to set up the infrastructure, for Starship, we need access to a kubernetes cluster.
One can either perform connect to a

- remote cluster in a managed kubernetes service
- use kubernetes desktop to spin up a cluster
- use kind to create a local cluster on local machine

To make this easier we have a handy command which will create a local kind cluster and give you access
to a kubernetes cluster locally.

NOTE: Resources constraint on local machine will affect the performance of Starship spinup time

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

## 3. Start Starship

Now with the dependencies and a kubernetes cluster in handy, we can proceed with creating the mini-cosmos ecosystem

Run

```bash
yarn starship:all
# or
yarn starship start
```

We use the config file `configs/config.yaml` as the genesis file to define the topology of the e2e test infra. Change it as required

Note: Spinup will take some time, while you wait for the system, can check the progress in another tab with `kubectl get pods`

## 4. Run the tests

We have everything we need, our desired infrastructure is now running as intended, now we can run
our end-to-end tests.

Run

```bash
yarn starship:test
```

### Available Tests

The test suite includes comprehensive end-to-end tests covering Ethereum functionality including native ETH transfers, smart contract interactions, and utility functions:

#### Token Transfer Tests (`token.test.ts`)

Comprehensive testing of Ethereum token transfers and smart contract interactions:

- **ETH Transfers (Legacy)**: Tests native ETH transfers using legacy transaction format
- **ETH Transfers (EIP-1559)**: Tests native ETH transfers using EIP-1559 transaction format with dynamic fees
- **Smart Contract Deployment**: Tests deploying ERC-20 USDT contract to the test network
- **ERC-20 Token Transfers**: Tests transferring ERC-20 tokens between accounts
- **Personal Message Signing**: Tests signing arbitrary messages using personal_sign
- **WebSocket Event Monitoring**: Tests real-time monitoring of smart contract events
- **Key Scenarios**:
  - Sending ETH between accounts with balance verification and gas fee calculation
  - Deploying USDT smart contract and verifying deployment success
  - Transferring USDT tokens and verifying balance changes
  - Signing personal messages and validating signature format
  - Monitoring Transfer events via WebSocket for real-time contract interaction tracking
  - Testing both legacy and EIP-1559 transaction types for compatibility

**Network-Specific Considerations**:

- Uses local Hardhat node (http://127.0.0.1:8545) for testing
- Tests with pre-funded accounts using deterministic private keys
- Includes WebSocket testing (ws://127.0.0.1:8546) for event monitoring
- Validates proper gas estimation and fee calculation for different transaction types
- Tests contract interaction patterns including deployment, method calls, and event listening

#### Utility Function Tests (`utils.test.ts`)

Tests core Ethereum utility functions for address validation and data encoding:

- **Address Validation**: Tests Ethereum address format validation and checksum verification
- **Address Conversion**: Tests conversion between different address formats (lowercase, uppercase, checksum)
- **Data Encoding**: Tests UTF-8 to hex encoding and decoding functions
- **Error Handling**: Tests proper error handling for invalid inputs
- **Key Scenarios**:
  - Validating checksummed, lowercase, and uppercase Ethereum addresses
  - Detecting invalid checksum addresses and rejecting them
  - Converting addresses to proper checksum format
  - Encoding UTF-8 strings to hexadecimal representation
  - Decoding hex strings back to UTF-8 with proper error handling
  - Testing edge cases like invalid hex strings and malformed addresses

**Testing Patterns**:

- Comprehensive address format testing including EIP-55 checksum validation
- Bidirectional encoding/decoding tests to ensure data integrity
- Error boundary testing for malformed inputs
- Validation of utility function reliability for production use

## 5. Stop the infra

The tests should be ideompotent, so the tests can be run multiple times (which is recommeded), since the time to spinup is still high (around 5 to 10 mins).

Once the state of the mini-cosmos is corrupted, you can stop the deployments with

```bash
yarn starship:clean
```

Which will

- Stop port-forwarding the traffic to your local
- Delete all the helm charts deployed
