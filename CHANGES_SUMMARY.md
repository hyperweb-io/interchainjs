# Summary of Changes

## Overview
Created version-specific protocol adapters for Tendermint/CometBFT to handle response decoding differences between protocol versions 0.34, 0.37, and 0.38.

## Files Created

### 1. `/workspace/networks/cosmos/src/adapters/base.ts`
- Base abstract class `BaseAdapter` implementing `ResponseDecoder` interface
- Common utility methods for all adapters (apiToNumber, apiToBigInt, etc.)
- Abstract methods for all RPC response decoders

### 2. `/workspace/networks/cosmos/src/adapters/tendermint34.ts`
- `Tendermint34Adapter` class extending BaseAdapter
- Handles Tendermint 0.34 specific response formats:
  - Uses `parts` in BlockId structure
  - Has `beginBlockEvents` and `endBlockEvents` in block results
  - Basic validator and consensus parameter structures

### 3. `/workspace/networks/cosmos/src/adapters/tendermint37.ts`
- `Tendermint37Adapter` class extending BaseAdapter
- Handles Tendermint 0.37 specific response formats:
  - Uses `part_set_header` instead of `parts` in BlockId
  - Still has `beginBlockEvents` and `endBlockEvents`
  - Added fields: `timeIotaMs`, `maxBytes` in evidence, `appVersion`

### 4. `/workspace/networks/cosmos/src/adapters/comet38.ts`
- `Comet38Adapter` class extending BaseAdapter
- Handles CometBFT 0.38 specific response formats:
  - Uses `part_set_header` in BlockId
  - Replaced begin/end block events with `finalizeBlockEvents`
  - Added `appHash` in block results
  - Added ABCI consensus params with `voteExtensionsEnableHeight`

### 5. `/workspace/networks/cosmos/src/adapters/index.ts`
- Export file for all adapters

### 6. `/workspace/networks/cosmos/src/adapters/README.md`
- Documentation explaining the differences between versions
- Usage examples

### 7. `/workspace/networks/cosmos/examples/adapter-usage.ts`
- Example demonstrating how different adapters handle the same response

## Files Modified

### 1. `/workspace/networks/cosmos/src/protocol-adapter.ts`
- Added imports for the new adapters
- Modified `TendermintProtocolAdapter` constructor to instantiate the appropriate adapter based on version
- Updated `decodeResponse` method to use version-specific decoders for each RPC method
- Added support for broadcast transaction methods

### 2. `/workspace/networks/cosmos/src/types/protocol.ts`
- Added missing RPC methods: `BROADCAST_TX_SYNC`, `BROADCAST_TX_ASYNC`, `BROADCAST_TX_COMMIT`

## Key Features

1. **Version-specific decoding**: Each adapter handles the specific response format for its protocol version
2. **Consistent output**: All adapters produce consistent TypeScript objects regardless of the underlying protocol version
3. **Type safety**: Uses `fromBase64` and `fromHex` from `@interchainjs/encoding` for proper encoding/decoding
4. **No external dependencies**: No imports from cosmjs as requested
5. **Extensible design**: Easy to add support for new protocol versions by creating new adapters

## Usage

The adapters are automatically selected when creating a `TendermintProtocolAdapter`:

```typescript
import { TendermintProtocolAdapter } from './protocol-adapter.js';
import { ProtocolVersion } from './types/protocol.js';

// Automatically uses Tendermint34Adapter
const adapter = new TendermintProtocolAdapter(ProtocolVersion.TENDERMINT_34);

// Decode responses
const decodedResponse = adapter.decodeResponse(RpcMethod.BLOCK, rawResponse);
```

The existing `CosmosQueryClient` will automatically benefit from these version-specific adapters without any code changes.
